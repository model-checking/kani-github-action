## Kani Github Action

This repository provides a GitHub Action for running the [Kani Rust Verifier](https://github.com/model-checking/kani) in CI.

⚠️ **Important Notice**: We have recently released the action [Kani Rust Verifier `v1`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/kani-rust-verifier),
which will install the latest version of Kani by default.
Please be aware that version `0.38` will be the final release where the version of Kani matches the version of Kani Github Action.
Make sure to update your workflows and references accordingly.
To select a specific version of Kani Rust Verifier, please add a semver version to the field `kani-version` as shown in the example below.

Example:

```
jobs:
  kani:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Kani
        uses: model-checking/kani-github-action@v1
        with:
          kani-version: '0.35.0'
